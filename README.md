### The Intake Dashboard

This repository is used to generate a dashboard that allows statuses for various
services to be shown for all intake-related packages.

The main configuration of the dashboard is done via the ``dashboard.yml`` file,
which can contain several sections, and a list of packages for each section.

The dashboard can be seen [here](http://continuumio.github.io/intake/intake-dashboard/status.html)
